# Rosalind Solver

This program integrates [my solutions to the rosalind problems:](https://github.com/TimBerneiser/rosalind_solutions) (and more things I can think of) into a GUI built with tkinter and tkinter bootstrap.  
Be aware that it serves mostly as an exercise for myself in working with github repositories, python packages, etc, than building an aesthetic GUI...
